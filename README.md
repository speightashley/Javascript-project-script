# Javascript-project-script

## About the project

This project was created because I was fed up of having to type out command after command to get a barebones JS project started.

The script is a bash script that:

- Takes a project name as input from the user
- Creates a remote Github repo for that project
- Sets up a local folder with git started
- Creates bare bones files - index.html, script.js, style.css
- Sets ESlint and Prettier up in the same directory

### Todo

- Support for starting React projects
- Support for Python web projects

## Tools

If tools are not installed on the machine, it will set them up.

The tools it sets up are:

- Git
- GithubCLI
- NodeJS

## Distributions it works on

The script is built to run on Arch based Linux distros

It wouldn't be too difficult to refactor the code to work on Ubuntu or Redhat falvoured distros

If someone wants to add the package manager support for any other distro, just stick a pull request in.

## Usage

There are no flags setup for the script

You just need to start the terminal and change the permissions of the script with chmod

```
$ sudo chmod u+x dev_env.sh
$ ./dev_env.sh
```

```
